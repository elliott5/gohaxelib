package hxbuiltin // This package contains functions over-loaded by the Go to Haxe transpiler

// Insert the given Haxe code at this point.
// BEWARE! It is very easy to write code that will break the system.
// code string must be a constant containing a well-formed Haxe statement, probably terminated with a ";"
// ret is a Haxe Dynamic value mapped into Go as a uintptr
func HAXE(code string) (ret uintptr) { return }

// returns the Host language (i.e. "Go" or "Haxe"), the return value is overridden to give correct host language name
func Host() string { return "Go" }

// Return language specific the Platform information, the return value is overridden at runtime
// for "Haxe" as host this returns the target language platform as one of: "flash","js","neko","php","cpp","java","cs"
func Platform() string { return "go" }

// Return a string containing the Go code position in terms of file name and line number
func CPos() string { return "<<go code pos>>" } // the return value is overwridden by the transpiler, here just for Go use

// Zilen() returns the runtime native string length of the chinese character "å­—", meaning "written character", which is pronounced "zi" in Mandarin.
// For UTF8 encoding this value is 3, for UTF16 encoding this value is 1.
func Zilen() uint { return 3 }
